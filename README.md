**AI-Powered Software, Human-Centered Solutions**

Welcome to **Nescka** — a software and AI engineering studio founded by [Nick Basinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickbasinger/).  
We design and build **intelligent, production-ready systems** that bridge the gap between modern AI and real-world business impact.

## 🚀 What We Do

At Nescka, we craft end-to-end solutions that combine **AI, automation, and modern software architecture**.  
We focus on turning ideas into working systems — reliable, maintainable, and explainable.

### Core Areas
- **AI Systems Architecture** – From prototype to production, we design systems that scale.  
- **Workflow Automation** – Using tools like `n8n`, `AWS Fargate`, and `vLLM` to connect data and intelligence.  
- **Custom Electron + Web Apps** – Beautiful, cross-platform tools powered by Node.js, React, and TypeScript.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure** – AWS-native deployments (S3, Lambda, Fargate, CDK, Bedrock, and more).  
- **Data Engineering** – ETL pipelines, embeddings, vector/graph databases (Neo4j, Qdrant, pgvector).  
- **Applied ML & LLM Integration** – Retrieval-augmented generation, intelligent search, and semantic workflows.

## 🧭 Our Philosophy

> **AI should serve people — not replace them.**

We believe in building technology that **enhances human capability**, **simplifies decision-making**, and **creates clarity** in complex systems.  
Each project is guided by three principles:

1. **Reliability** – Enterprise-grade design and maintainability.  
2. **Empathy** – Interfaces and automations that feel human-friendly.  
3. **Integrity** – Transparency in data, models, and decision logic.
